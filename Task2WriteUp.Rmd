# Task 2: Feature Selection

## Abstract Task 2
The focus of the following analysis is to attempt to achieve high classification accuracy, while using a minimal number of features on very highly dimensional data. We will use a combination of six different feature selection and classification techniques to accomplish the goal. The models and methods used are a combination of methods taught in our ST443 Machine Learning and Data Mining Course taught at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences, and other techniques used from personal research. 

## Data Description
We were given one dataset that contains binary features that describe the three-dimensional properties of a molecule in a compound or a random probe across different compounds. The data contains 800 observations, which represent 800 compounds, and 100,000 columns (50,000 real variables and 50,000 random probes). The first column named $label$ represents whether a compound bound to a target site on thrombin^[1].








[1] Thrombin is an enzyme that plays a key role in blood clotting and other biological processes.
