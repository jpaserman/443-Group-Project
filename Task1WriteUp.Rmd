# Task 1: Binary Classification

## Abstract Task 1

-   abstract/overview of task

## Task 1.1 Data Description

-   summary statistics
-   plots

## Task 1.2 Summary Table without PCA

-   short intro (1-2 sentences what every classifier does)
-   after showing summary table, add explanation to specific occurances like the QDA or kNN or SVM

| w/o PCA  | Accuracy | Bal. Accuracy | AUC | F1  |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----|-----|
| LDA      |          |               |     |     |
| Logistic |          |               |     |     |
| QDA      |          |               |     |     |
| k-NN     |          |               |     |     |
| GDBT     |          |               |     |     |
| RF       |          |               |     |     |
| SVM      |          |               |     |     |

## Task 1.2 Summary Table with PCA

-   explanation of what PCA does and how it is essentially applied for all classifiers

| with PCA | Accuracy | Bal. Accuracy | AUC | F1  |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----|-----|
| LDA      |          |               |     |     |
| Logistic |          |               |     |     |
| QDA      |          |               |     |     |
| k-NN     |          |               |     |     |
| GDBT     |          |               |     |     |
| RF       |          |               |     |     |
| SVM      |          |               |     |     |

## Task 1.3 Improved Classifiers

-   Summary Table: of F1 before and F1 after improvement

|                       | F1 Score before | F1 Score after |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| QDA/LDA??             |                 |                |
| Logistic (with Ridge) |                 |                |
| RF (with AdaBoost)    |                 |                |

-   explanation how each classifier was improved and why this improvement method was chosen

## Task 1.4 Final predict function

-   summary and discussion of the results

|             | Accuracy | Bal. Accuracy | AUC | F1 Score |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-----|----------|
| mypredict() |          |               |     |          |

-   present in one row all performance metrics of chosen prediction function
